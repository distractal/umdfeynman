***STEINER What does "HANDLE" mean in "Handle for transactions in which one or more prescriptions for medicines not in stock."

1 - highest
***STEINER Do reports need to provide quantity, dollar amounts, or both?  (Start with 1)both
***STEINER - What time of day on 4/28
***STEINER:  Does sequence checking for Create/Delete store need to take into account previous adddeletestore.txt sequence number (Do we need to store this?)
***STEINER:  Is sequence number for entire batch process or is it per-segment (Create/Delete Store, Update Inventory, etc).
***Check recording:  What is purpose for date in all the files (YYYY-MM-DD)?  To determine date for transactions?  Do we need to track this for other actions?  Don't need to do anything with date

Ask after class:
***Check recording for sequence mismatch:  Dump out of entire process or proceed to next batch subprogram?
	Proceed to next batch subprogram.

***TDD?
***Algo first, one program, few header files, many
classes, many methods

STEINER:  Program documents:  White box testing.

- Stop algorithm breakdown, switch to determining tests based on use cases.

// No preexisting database files:  Create and initialize in-memory stuff to 0.

*** STEINER - If unexpected action code, stop reading file or proceed to next line?

 If "out of order error - ADIC parse fails" - skip iteration and log appropriate error message
 ///////////////////**** DO WE CONTINUE HERE OR DROP OUT OF THIS BATCH SUBPROGRAM? -- STEINER

 *** STEINER - If count of items does not match item count record stop batch subprogram and move on, or do WHAT?

 *** STEINER - When we read from the storeupdate.txt file during the adddeletestore process should we update the file sequence number?

 *** STEINER - 

Unanswered:

 *** STEINER - For a given input file during the entire batch process, should the file sequence number be updated each time the file is read, even if it is read multiple times during a single run of the batch process?  Or should it only be updated the very last time the file is read in the current run of the batch process?
