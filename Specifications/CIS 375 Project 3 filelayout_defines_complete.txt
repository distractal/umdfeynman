Be sure to update your artifacts with any assumptions, business rules and the order that files must be loaded.

Generate log file(s) with output of run sequence - execution and errors.

Header and Trailer records on ALL files - Account for SEQ# rollover!!!!

Header
HD<space>SEQ#(4 digits - zero fill)<6 spaces>YYYY-MM-DD<remainder of line to file record size is spaces> 

Trailer
T<space>#ROWS(4 digits - zero fill) - Note: #Rows does NOT include control records (e.g. header)

Log errors as they occur. File not found, no header record, error in SEQ# - log error message and stop program. For all other errors log error message and continue. Assume error data will be corrected with submission of next version of the file.


Assumption: all data items described exist on the actual files (e.g. date on HD record, item expiration date) but if YOUR application does not use it you can ignore that data field 


CREATE/DELETE STORE 

May be "empty" --- header and trailer #ROWS = 0

Add store - add store to company list of stores, create list of items in store with default inventory levels, Will cause inventory to be shipped to store location write out a file that will be input into INVENTORY TO STORE REQUEST process
Delete store - remove all inventory from store - sending back to warehouse - write out a file that will be input into ITEM INVENTORY RECEIVED AT WAREHOUSE process

HD SEQ#      YYYY-MM-DD 
|action code 'A' or 'D'|store id|street address|city name|state|zip code|store priority level|
|action code 'I'|item code|store default quantity|store reorder level|store reorder quantity|
|action code 'C'|<space>|count| 
T #ROWS

HD header record, seq number must be next up value or reject file, date (no process at this time)

action code = 'A' add or 'D' delete store, 'I' for item, 'C' for control 
'A' or 'D' - all fields required - do not add store if store id already exists, do not perform delete unless ALL data fields match, error if no 'I' records following an 'A' or if 'I' records follow a 'D'
store id = 5 digits (zero fill)
street address = 20 characters
city = 20 characters 
state = 2 characters
zip code = 9 digits (no "-", 9 digits)
store priority level = 2 digits (zero fill, range 01 - 15)
'I' - all items required, item must exist
item code = 9 digits (zero filled)
store default quantity = 10 digits (zero filled)
store reorder level = 10 digits (zero fill)
store reorder quantity = 10 digits (zero fill)
'C' - number of item records for that store
space
count = 4 digits - number of item records for that store, zero fill, error if incorrect value, display error message but continue processing 
T trailer record, report error if number of data records is incorrect

INVENTORY TO STORE REQUEST

combination of batch inventory review input file, create store, online request - all have the SAME layout - must combine all three sources into one file

HD SEQ#      YYYY-MM-DD
